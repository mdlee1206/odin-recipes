    <h4>How to Cook Flank Steak</h4>

    <p>There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak is grilled â€” we love the bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can also easily cook 
        your flank steak in the oven or on the stove. You'll find the step-by-step recipe for marinated and grilled flank steak below, but here are some rough guidelines for three different 
        flank steak cooking methods:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>On the grill</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly oiled outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the 
            marinade, shake off excess liquid, and grill on each side to desired doneness. The steak is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 degrees F and
             145 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>In the oven</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and 
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/283335/braised-flank-steak-in-the-oven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrange the steaks in a baking dish</a> lined with 
            aluminum foil. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>On the stove</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe.
             <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262181/cast-iron-pan-seared-steak-oven-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sear the steaks in a cast-iron skillet</a> 
             until lightly browned on the bottom, then flip to the other side and repeat. Finish the steaks in a preheated oven. Bake until a meat thermometer inserte into the center of the 
             steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
    </ul>
